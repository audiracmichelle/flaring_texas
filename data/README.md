    * National Oil and Gas Assessment Province Boundaries through 2012
Within these provinces, Total Petroleum Systems are defined and Assessment Units are defined and assessed. Each of province is defined geologically, and most province boundaries are defined by major geologic changes. This dataset is a compilation of data that has been studied and published separately, and in some cases adjacent provinces do not share a common boundary. As a consequence, there are numerous gaps and overlaps in this layer.
